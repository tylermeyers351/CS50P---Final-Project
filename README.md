    Description:
    This program takes a city, as input from the user, and checks to see if the
    user's inputted city matches with a list of over 42,000 cities per the 'worldcities.csv.'
    Once the input is confirmed to exist within the list, the program prints out the
    population (from the CSV) as well as data from a weather API. The data pulled from
    the API includes temperature and the description of the weather. Lastly, some emoji's
    are printed to show the author's reaction to the weather.

    API URL: https://openweathermap.org/
    Original CSV: https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities

    With this project I wanted to focus on what I thought was important in
    the world of programming. Basically, I wanted to learn how to take data, in its various forms,
    and spit out readable/usable data. With this project, I utilized two separate kinds
    of data input. One, with a CSV, and the other with an API. With this data, I was able to spit
    out some useful information about a city's population and weather.

    I took about four or five hours building the core functionality of the project, and of course,
    spent some additional time working on the admin side of this project (testing, video, submitting).
    It was time well spent. If I wanted, I could have spent some time implementing additional features
    and more data within this project, but I'm satisified with the current scope as a first
    programming project. I think it is a great building block, and shows potential, as well as
    many areas of improvement that I can focus on as I develop as a programmer. This project
    helped develop some confidence in myself, and I'm excited to see what's next!
